Additionally, there are two antennas on top of the head, with tips that can emit bright yellow light.<br></br><br></br>Gnarpy's mouth resembles a human's mustache, quite distinctive. Xyr arms and legs, aside from being bright green, also have several dark green stripes, adding some embellishment to xyr image. <br></br><br></br>Like a cat, Gnarpy has a tail, also in bright green, featuring two dark green stripes. If you just look at the tail, it's like a caterpillar. Moreover, Gnarpy's eyes are always closed, adding a touch of simplicity to xyr demeanor.",

What's more, where there were two eyes before, there are now four.<br></br>Additionally, an important update is that the new Gnarpy has added clothing and boots, both in dark red. The clothing features a dark yellow little star on the chest. Also, the legs, which were bright green before, have now turned yellow. The dark green stripes across the body have also increased in number.<br></br>The old model of Gnarpy seemed as if its entire body was assembled from several blocks, while the new model of Gnarpy has limbs that are more anthropomorphic. The face still resembles that of a cat. However, due to the number of limbs, many say xe is a cat from another planet.<br></br><br></br>Notably, on Xyr Halloween skin, xe has patches on his right arm, left foot, and waist.",
